3D renderer written from scratch in C. **Purely** for educational purposes, as I want to better understand the
beautiful mathematics behind it all.

In order to build the program take a look at the [cmake file](./CMakeLists.txt). In a nutshell [SDL2](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/tag/release-2.30.0), [SDL2 Image](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_image/releases/tag/release-2.8.2), [SDL2 TTF](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_ttf/releases/tag/release-2.22.0) and [micro-ui](https://github.com/rxi/microui) are required dependencies, the latter of which is added as a [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).

I've used two primary resources, and I want to extend gratitude to the people behind those resources:

- [Gustavo Pezzi](https://twitter.com/pikuma)

Gustavo's course [3D Computer Graphics Programming](https://pikuma.com/courses/learn-3d-computer-graphics-programming) has been my main resources to get an introductory understanding of 3D maths.
Gustavo is a phenomenal teacher with a great focus on mathematics. His clarity and thoroughness is something I value a great deal.
Besides, he also has a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@pikuma) with loads of free awesome content.

The book [3D Math Primer for Graphics and Game Development](https://gamemath.com/book/intro.html)
contains excellent explanations (with problems) and has been an enjoyable read. It's even free! Thank you, Fletcher Dunn.
