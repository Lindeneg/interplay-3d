3D renderer written from scratch in C. **Purely** for educational purposes, as I want to better understand the
beautiful mathematics behind it all.

#### Acknowledgements

I've used two primary resources, and I want to extend gratitude to the people behind those resources:

-   [Gustavo Pezzi](https://twitter.com/pikuma)

Gustavo's course [3D Computer Graphics Programming](https://pikuma.com/courses/learn-3d-computer-graphics-programming) has been my main resources to get an introductory understanding of 3D maths.
Gustavo is a phenomenal teacher with a great focus on mathematics. His clarity and thoroughness is something I value a great deal.
Besides, he also has a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@pikuma) with loads of free awesome content.

The book [3D Math Primer for Graphics and Game Development](https://gamemath.com/book/intro.html)
contains excellent explanations (with problems) and has been an enjoyable read. It's even free! Thank you, Fletcher Dunn.
